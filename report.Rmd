# The exponential distribution and the Central Limit Theorem
Yaroslav Yermilov

## Overview

In this report we will investigate the exponential distribution and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The mean of exponential distribution is choosen to be 5 and the standard deviation is also 5. We will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials in 1000 simulations.

As part of analysys we will:
1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
1. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
1. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
